\facespeaks Believe it, I will.\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{Believe it, I will.} Thy worst. I fart at thee.\\
\dolspeaks Have you your wits? Why gentlemen, for love---\\
\facespeaks Sirrah, I'll strip you---\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{Sirrah, I'll strip you---} What to do? Lick figs\\
Out at my---\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Out at my---} Rogue, rogue! Out of all your sleights.\\
\dolspeaks Nay look ye, Sovereign, General, are you madmen?\\
\subtlespeaks O, let the wild sheep loose.
\dolspeaks \vinphantom{O, let the wild sheep loose.} Sirs, will you have\\
The neighbours hear you? Will you betray all?\\
Hark, I hear somebody.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Hark, I hear somebody.} You insolent slave,\\
Dare you do this?\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{Dare you do this?} Yes faith; yes faith.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Dare you do this? Yes, faith; yes, faith.} Why, who\\
Am I, my mungrel? Who am I?\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{Am I, my mungrel? who am I?} I'll tell you,\\
Since you know not yourself---\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Since you know not yourself---} Speak lower, rogue.\\
\subtlespeaks Yes, you were once, time's not long past, the good,\\
Honest, plain, livery-three-pound-thrum, that kept\\
Your master's worship's house here in the Friars\\
For the vacations---\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{For the vacations---} Will you be so loud?\\
\subtlespeaks Since, by my means, translated suburb-captain.\\
\facespeaks By your means, Doctor Dog!\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{By your means, Doctor Dog!} Within man's memory\\
All this I speak of.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{All this I speak of.} Why, I pray you, have I\\
Been countenanced by you or you by me?\\
Do but collect, sir, where I met you first.\\
\subtlespeaks I do not hear well.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{I do not hear well.} Not of this, I think it.\\
But I shall put you in mind, sir: at Pie Corner,\\
Taking your meal of steam in from cooks' stalls\\
Where, like the father of hunger, you did walk\\
Stuck full of black and melancholic worms.\\
\subtlespeaks I wish you could advance your voice a little.\\
\facespeaks When you went pinned up in the several rags\\
You had raked and picked from dunghills before day;\\
A felt of rug and a thin threaden cloak\\
That scarce would cover your no buttocks---\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{That scarce would cover your no buttocks---} So, sir!\\
\facespeaks When all your alchemy and your algebra,\\
Your conjuring, cozening and your dozen of trades\\
Could not relieve your corps with so much linen\\
I gave you countenance, credit for your coals,\\
Your stills, your glasses, your materials;\\
Built you a furnace, drew you customers,\\
Advanced all your black arts; lent you, beside,\\
A house to practise in---\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{A house to practise in---} Your master's house!\\
\facespeaks Where you have studied the more thriving skill\\
Of bawdry since.\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{Of bawdry since.} Yes, in your master's house.\\
You and the rats have kept possession\\
Here since your mistress' death hath broke up house.\\
\facespeaks You might talk softlier, rascal.\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{You might talk softlier, rascal.} No, you scarab,\\
I'll thunder you in pieces: I will teach you\\
How to beware to tempt a Fury again,\\
That carries tempest in his hand and voice.\\
\facespeaks The place has made you valiant.\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{The place has made you valiant.} No, your clothes.\\
Thou vermin, have I taken thee out of dung,\\
So poor, so wretched, when no living thing\\
Would keep thee company but a spider or worse?\\
Raised thee from brooms and dust and watering-pots,\\
Sublimed thee and exalted thee and fixed thee\\
In the third region, called our state of grace?\\
Given thee thy oaths, thy quarrelling dimensions,\\
Made thee a second in mine own great art?\\
And have I this for thanks! Do you rebel?\\
Would you be gone now?\\
\dolspeaks \vinphantom{Would you be gone now?} Gentlemen, what mean you?\\
Will you mar all?\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{Will you mar all?} Slave, thou hadst had no name---\\
\dolspeaks Will you undo yourselves with civil war?\\
\subtlespeaks Had not I been.\\
\dolspeaks \vinphantom{---had not I been.} Do you know who hears you, Sovereign?\\
\facespeaks Sirrah---\\
\dolspeaks \vinphantom{Sirrah---} Nay, General, I thought you were civil.\\
\facespeaks I shall turn desperate, if you grow thus loud.\\
\subtlespeaks And hang thyself, I care not.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{And hang thyself, I care not.} Hang thee, collier,\\
And all thy pots and pans---
\dolspeaks \vinphantom{And all thy pots and pans---} This'll o'erthrow all.\\
\subtlespeaks Away, you trencher-rascal!\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Away, you trencher-rascal!} Dog-leech!\\
\subtlespeaks  \vinphantom{Away, you trencher-rascal! Dog-leech!} Cheater!\\
\facespeaks Bawd!\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{Bawd!} Cow-herd!\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Bawd! Cow-herd!} Conjurer!\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{Bawd! Cow-herd! Conjurer!} Cut-purse!\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Bawd! Cow-herd! Conjurer! Cut-purse!} Witch!\\
\dolspeaks \vinphantom{Bawd! Cow-herd! Conjurer! Cut-purse! Witch!} O me!\\
We are ruined! Lost! Have you no more regard\\
To your reputations? Where's your judgement? 'Slight!\\
\facespeaks Away this brach! I'll bring thee, rogue, within\\
A noose for laundering gold and barbing it.\\
\dolspeaks 'Sdeath, you abominable pair of stinkards,\\
Leave off your barking and grow one again\\
Or, by the light that shines, I'll cut your throats.\\
Have you together cozened all this while\\
And all the world and shall it now be said\\
You've made most courteous shift to cozen yourselves?\\
\direct*{To \face}
You will accuse him! Who shall take your word?\\
A whoreson, upstart, apocryphal captain?\\
\direct*{To \subtle}
And you too, cozening bawd, you will insult\\
And claim a primacy in the divisions?\\
You must be chief? As if you only had\\
The powder to project with and the work\\
Were not begun out of equality?\\
The venture tripartite? All things in common?\\
Without priority? 'Sdeath, you perpetual curs,\\
Fall to your couples again and cozen kindly\\
And heartily and lovingly, as you should,\\
Or, by this hand, I shall grow factious too\\
And take my part and quit you.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{And take my part and quit you.} 'Tis his fault;\\
He ever murmurs and objects his pains\\
And says the weight of all lies upon him.\\
\subtlespeaks Why, so it does.\\
\dolspeaks \vinphantom{Why, so it does.} How does it? Do not we\\
Sustain our parts?\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{Sustain our parts?} Yes, but they are not equal.\\
\dolspeaks Why, if your part exceed today, I hope\\
Ours may tomorrow match it.\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{Ours may tomorrow match it.} Ay, they \emph{may}.\\
\dolspeaks ``May'', murmuring mastiff? Ay and do, God's will!\\
Help me to throttle him.\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{Help me to throttle him.} Dorothy! Mistress Dorothy!\\
God's precious, I'll do any thing. What do you mean?\\
\dolspeaks Because of your fermentation and cibation?\\
\subtlespeaks Not I, by heaven---\\
\dolspeaks \vinphantom{Not I, by heaven---} Your Sol and Luna?\\
\direct*{To \face}
\vinphantom{Not I, by heaven--- Your Sol and Luna?} Help me.\\
\subtlespeaks Would I were hanged then? I'll conform myself.\\
\dolspeaks Will you, sir? Do so then and quickly: swear.\\
\subtlespeaks What should I swear?\\
\dolspeaks \vinphantom{What should I swear?} To leave your faction, sir,\\
And labour kindly in the common work.\\
\subtlespeaks Let me not breathe if I meant aught beside.\\
I only used those speeches as a spur\\
To him.\\
\dolspeaks \vinphantom{To him.} I hope we need no spurs, sir. Do we?\\
\facespeaks 'Slid, prove today who shall shark best.\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{'Slid, prove today who shall shark best.} Agreed.\\
\dolspeaks Yes and work close and friendly.\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{Yes and work close and friendly.} 'Slight, the knot\\
Shall grow the stronger for this breach with me.\\
\dolspeaks Why so, my good baboons! Shall we go make\\
A sort of sober, scurvy, precise neighbours\\
A feast of laughter at our follies?
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{A feast of laughter at our follies?} Dol!\\
Spoken like Claridiana and thyself.\\
\facespeaks For which at supper, thou shalt sit in triumph\\
And not be styled Dol Common, but Dol Proper,\\
Dol Singular: the longest cut at night\\
Shall draw thee for his Doll Particular.\\

\scene

\direct*{\dapper enters outside and knocks}
\subtlespeaks Who's that? One knocks. To the window, Dol. Pray heaven\\
The master do not trouble us this quarter.\\
\facespeaks  O, fear not him. While there dies one a week\\
Of the plague he's safe from thinking toward London.\\
Beside, he's busy at his hop-yards now;\\
I had a letter from him. If he do\\
He'll send such word for airing of the house\\
As you shall have sufficient time to quit it.\\
\subtlespeaks Who is it, Dol?\\
\dolspeaks \vinphantom{Who is it, Dol?} A fine young quodling.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Who is it, Dol? A fine young quodling.} O,\\
My lawyer's clerk I lighted on last night\\
In Holborn at the Dagger. He would have,\\
I told you of him, a familiar\\
To rifle with at horses and win cups.\\
\dolspeaks O, let him in.\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{O, let him in.} Stay. Who shall do it?\\
\facespeaks \direct*{Dressing as the Captain} \vinphantom{O, let him in. Stay. Who shall do it?} Get you\\
Your robes on: I will meet him as going out.\\
\dolspeaks And what shall I do?\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{And what shall I do?} Not be seen. Away!\\
\direct*{Exit \dol inside}
Seem you very reserved.\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{Seem you very reserved.} Enough.\\
\direct*{Exit \subtle inside}
\facespeaks \direct*{Aloud, going to the door} \vinphantom{Seem you very reserved. Enough.} God be with you, sir,\\
I pray you let him know that I was here:\\
His name is Dapper. I would gladly have staid but---\\
\dapperspeaks \direct*{From outside} Captain, I am here.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Captain, I am here.} Who's that?---He's come I think, Doctor.\\
\direct*{Opening the door}
Good faith, sir, I was going away.\\
\direct*{\dapper comes inside}
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{Good faith, sir, I was going away.} In truth\\
I am very sorry, Captain.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{I am very sorry, Captain.} But I thought\\
Sure I should meet you.\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{Sure I should meet you.} Ay, I am very glad.\\
I had a scurvy writ or two to make\\
And lent my watch---\\
\direct*{Enter \subtle inside, dressed as the Alchemist}
\vinphantom{And lent my watch---} Is this the cunning man?\\
\facespeaks This is his worship.\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{This is his worship.} Is he a doctor?\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{This is his worship. Is he a doctor?} Yes.\\
\dapperspeaks And have you broke with him, Captain?\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{And have you broke with him, Captain?} Ay.\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{And have you broke with him, Captain? Ay.} And how?\\
\facespeaks Faith, he does make the matter, sir, so dainty\\
I know not what to say.\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{I know not what to say.} Not so, good captain.\\
\facespeaks Would I were fairly rid of it, believe me.\\
\dapperspeaks Nay, now you grieve me, sir. Why should you wish so?\\
I dare assure you I'll not be ungrateful.\\
\facespeaks I cannot think you will, sir. But the law\\
Is such a thing---Nay sir, you know the law\\
Better, I think---\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{Better, I think---} I should, sir, and the danger.\\
You know: I shewed the statute to you.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{You know: I shewed the statute to you.} You did so.\\
\dapperspeaks And will I tell? What do you think of me?\\
\facespeaks I'll tell the Doctor so.\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{I'll tell the Doctor so.} Do, good sweet Captain.\\
\facespeaks Come, noble Doctor, pray thee let's prevail.\\
\subtlespeaks Captain, I have returned you all my answer.\\
I would do much, sir, for your love. But this\\
I neither may nor can.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{I neither may nor can.} Tut, do not say so.\\
You deal now with a noble fellow, Doctor,\\
One that will thank you richly. And he has\\
Four angels here.\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{Four angels here.} You do me wrong, good sir.\\
\facespeaks Doctor, wherein? To tempt you with these spirits?\\
\subtlespeaks To tempt my art and love, sir, to my peril.\\
'Fore heaven, I scarce can think you are my friend,\\
That so would draw me to apparent danger.\\
\facespeaks I draw you? A horse draw you and a halter,\\
You and your flies together---\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{You and your flies together---} Nay, good Captain.\\
\facespeaks That know no difference of men.\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{That know no difference of men.} Good words, sir.\\
\facespeaks Good deeds, sir, Doctor Dogs-Meat. 'Slight, I bring you\\
No under-scribe---
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{No under-scribe---} Sir---
\facespeaks \vinphantom{No under-scribe--- Sir---} But a special gentle\\
That is the heir to forty marks a year,\\
Consorts with the small poets of the time,\\
Is the sole hope of his old grandmother.\\
That knows the law, is a fine clerk. And can court\\
His mistress out of Ovid.\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{His mistress out of Ovid.} Nay, dear captain---\\
\facespeaks Did you not tell me so?\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{Did you not tell me so?} Yes; but I'd have you\\
Use Master Doctor with some more respect.\\
\facespeaks Hang him, proud stag, with his broad velvet head!\\
But for your sake, I'd choke ere I would change\\
An article of breath with such a puff-ball.\\
\direct*{Leaving through the door}
Come, let's be gone.\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{Come, let's be gone.} Pray you let me speak with you.\\
\dapperspeaks His worship calls you, Captain.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{His worship calls you, Captain.} I am sorry\\
I e'er embarked myself in such a business.\\
\dapperspeaks Nay, good sir, he did call you.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Nay, good sir, he did call you.} Will he take then?\\
\subtlespeaks First, hear me---\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{First, hear me---} Not a syllable 'less you take.\\
\subtlespeaks Your humour must be law.\\
\direct*{He takes the money}
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Your humour must be law.} Why now, sir, talk.\\
Now I dare hear you with mine honour. Speak.\\
So may this gentleman too.\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{So may this gentleman too.} (Why, sir---)\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{So may this gentleman too. (Why, sir---)} No whispering.\\
\subtlespeaks 'Fore heaven, you do not apprehend the loss\\
You do yourself in this.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{You do yourself in this.} Wherein? For what?\\
\subtlespeaks Marry, to be so importunate for one\\
That, when he has it, will undo you all:\\
He'll win up all the money in the town.\\
\facespeaks How!\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{How!} Yes, and blow up gamester after gamester,\\
If I do give him a familiar.\\
Give you him all you play for, never set him:\\
For he will have it.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{For he will have it.} You are mistaken, Doctor.\\
Why he does ask one but for cups and horses,\\
A rifling fly; none of your great familiars.\\
\dapperspeaks Yes, Captain, I would have it for all games.\\
\subtlespeaks I told you so.\\
\facespeaks \direct*{Taking \dapper aside} \vinphantom{I told you so.} 'Slight, that is a new business!\\
I understood you: a tame bird to fly\\
Twice in a term, or so, on Friday nights,\\
When you had left the office; for a nag\\
Of forty or fifty shillings.\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{Of forty or fifty shillings.} Ay, 'tis true, sir;\\
But I do think now I shall leave the law\\
And therefore---\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{And therefore---} Why, this changes quite the case.\\
Do you think that I dare move him?\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{Do you think that I dare move him?} If you please, sir;\\
All's one to him, I see.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{All's one to him, I see.} What! For that money?\\
I cannot with my conscience; nor should you\\
Make the request, methinks.\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{Make the request, methinks.} No, sir, I mean\\
To add consideration.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{To add consideration.} Why then, sir,\\
I'll try. Say that it were for all games, Doctor.\\
\subtlespeaks He'll draw you all the treasure of the realm,\\
If it be set him.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{If it be set him.} Speak you this from art?\\
\subtlespeaks Ay, sir, and reason too, the ground of art.\\
He is of the only best complexion\\
The queen of Fairy loves.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{The queen of Fairy loves.} What! Is he?\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{The queen of Fairy loves. What! Is he?} Peace.\\
He'll overhear you. Sir, should she but see him---\\
\facespeaks What?\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{What?} Do not you tell him.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{What? Do not you tell him.} Will he win at cards too?\\
\subtlespeaks Such vigorous luck as cannot be resisted.
\facespeaks A strange success that some man shall be born to.\\
\subtlespeaks He hears you, man---\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{He hears you, man---} Sir, I'll not be ingrateful.\\
\facespeaks Faith, I have confidence in his good nature:\\
You hear, he says he will not be ingrateful.\\
\subtlespeaks Why, as you please; my venture follows yours.\\
\facespeaks Troth, do it, Doctor; think him trusty and make him.\\
He may make us both happy in an hour;\\
Win some five thousand pound, and send us two on't.\\
\dapperspeaks Believe it and I will, sir.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Believe it and I will, sir.} And you shall, sir.\\
You have heard all?\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{You have heard all?} No, what was it? Nothing, I, sir.\\
\direct*{Takes him aside}
\facespeaks Nothing?\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{Nothing?} A little, sir.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Nothing? A little, sir.} Well, a rare star\\
Reigned at your birth.\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{Reigned at your birth.} At mine, sir? No.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Reigned at your birth. At mine, sir? No.} The Doctor\\
Swears that you are---\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{Swears that you are---} Nay, Captain, you'll tell all now.\\
\facespeaks Allied to the queen of Fairy.\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{Allied to the queen of Fairy.} Who, I am?\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Allied to the queen of Fairy. Who, I am?} Come,\\
You know it well enough, though you dissemble it.\\
\dapperspeaks I'fac, I do not; you are mistaken.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{I'fac, I do not; you are mistaken.} How!\\
Swear by your fac and in a thing so known\\
Unto the Doctor? How shall we, sir, trust you\\
In the other matter? Can we ever think,\\
When you have won five or six thousand pound,\\
You'll send us shares in it, by this rate?\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{You'll send us shares in it, by this rate?} By Gad, sir,\\
I'll win ten thousand pound and send you half.\\
I'fac's no oath.\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{I'fac's no oath.} No, no, he did but jest.\\
\facespeaks Go to. Go thank the Doctor: he's your friend\\
To take it so.\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{To take it so.} I thank his worship.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{To take it so. I thank his worship.} So!\\
Another angel.\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{Another angel.} Must I?\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Another angel. Must I?} Must you? 'Slight,\\
What else is thanks? Will you be trivial? Doctor,\\
\direct*{\dapper gives him the money}
When must he come for his familiar?\\
\dapperspeaks Shall I not have it with me?\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{Shall I not have it with me?} O, good sir!\\
There must a world of ceremonies pass:\\
You must be bathed and fumigated first.\\
Besides, the queen of Fairy does not rise\\
Till it be noon.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Till it be noon.} Not if she danced tonight.\\
\subtlespeaks And she must bless it.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{And she must bless it.} Did you never see\\
Her royal grace yet?\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{Her royal grace yet?} Whom?\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Her royal grace yet? Whom?} Your aunt of Fairy?\\
\subtlespeaks Not since she kist him in the cradle, Captain;\\
I can resolve you that.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{I can resolve you that.} Well, see her grace,\\
Whate'er it cost you, for a thing that I know.\\
It will be somewhat hard to compass; but\\
However, see her. You are made, believe it,\\
If you can see her. Her grace is a lone woman\\
And very rich; and if she take a fancy\\
She will do strange things. See her at any hand.\\
'Slid, she may hap to leave you all she has:\\
It is the Doctor's fear.\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{It is the Doctor's fear.} How will it be done, then?\\
\facespeaks Let me alone, take you no thought. Do you\\
But say to me, Captain, I'll see her grace.\\
\dapperspeaks Captain, I'll see her grace.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Captain, I'll see her grace.} Enough.\\
\direct*{\drugger enters outside and knocks at the door}
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{Captain, I'll see her grace. Enough.} Who's there?\\
Anon. (Conduct him forth by the back way.)\\
\direct*{To \dapper}
Sir, against one o'clock prepare yourself;\\
Till when you must be fasting; only take\\
Three drops of vinegar in at your nose,\\
Two at your mouth and one at either ear;\\
Then bathe your fingers' ends and wash your eyes,\\
To sharpen your five senses and cry ``hum''\\
Thrice and then ``buzz'' as often; and then come.\\
\facespeaks Can you remember this?\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{Can you remember this?} I warrant you.\\
\facespeaks Well then, away. It is but your bestowing\\
Some twenty nobles among her grace's servants,\\
And put on a clean shirt: you do not know\\
What grace her grace may do you in clean linen.\\

\direct*{\subtle opens the door, \drugger comes inside}
\subtlespeaks Come in! Your name is Annie Drugger?\\
\druggerspeaks \vinphantom{Come in! Your name is Annie Drugger?} Yes, sir.\\
\subtlespeaks A seller of tobacco?\\
\druggerspeaks \vinphantom{A seller of tobacco?} Yes, sir.\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{A seller of tobacco? Yes, sir.} Well:\\
Your business, Annie?\\
\druggerspeaks \vinphantom{Your business, Annie?} This, an't please your worship;\\
I am just a beginner and am building\\
Of a new shop, an't like your worship, just\\
At corner of a street. Here is the plot on't.\\
And I would know by art, sir, of your worship,\\
Which way I should make my door, by necromancy,\\
And where my shelves; and which should be for boxes\\
And which for pots. I would be glad to thrive, sir:\\
And I was wished to your worship by a gentleman,\\
One Captain Face, that says you know men's planets\\
And their good angels and their bad.\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{And their good angels and their bad.} I do,\\
If I do see them---\\

\facespeaks \vinphantom{If I do see them---} What! My honest Annie?\\
Though art well met here.\\
\druggerspeaks \vinphantom{Though art well met here.} Troth, sir, I was speaking,\\
Just as your worship came here, of your worship:\\
I pray you speak for me to Master Doctor.\\
\facespeaks He shall do any thing. Doctor, do you hear?\\
This is my friend, Annie, an honest woman;\\
She lets me have good tobacco and she does not\\
Sophisticate it with sack-lees or oil;\\
A neat, spruce, honest woman and no goldsmith.\\
\subtlespeaks She is a fortunate woman, that I am sure on.\\
\facespeaks Already, sir, have you found it? Lo thee, Annie!\\
\subtlespeaks And in right way toward riches---\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{And in right way toward riches---} Sir!\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{And in right way toward riches--- Sir!} 'Tis true.\\
\facespeaks 'Slid, Doctor, how canst thou know this so soon?\\
I am amused at that!\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{I am amused at that!} By a rule, Captain,\\
In metoposcopy, which I do work by;\\
A certain star in the forehead, which you see not.\\
Your chestnut or your olive-coloured face\\
Does never fail and your long ear doth promise.\\
I knew it by certain spots, too, in her teeth\\
And on the nail of her mercurial finger.\\
\facespeaks Which finger's that?\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{Which finger's that?} Her little finger, look.\\
You were born upon a Wednesday?\\
\druggerspeaks \vinphantom{You were born upon a Wednesday?} Yes indeed, sir.\\
\subtlespeaks The thumb, in chiromancy, we give Venus;\\
The fore-finger to Jove; the midst to Saturn;\\
The ring to Sol; the least to Mercury,\\
Who was the lord, sir, of her horoscope,\\
Her house of life being Libra; which fore-showed\\
She should be a merchant and should trade with balance.\\
\facespeaks Why, this is strange! Is it not, honest Nan?\\
\direct*{Pointing to the plan}
\subtlespeaks Now, Nan, this is the west and this the south?\\
\druggerspeaks Yes, sir.\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{Yes, sir.} And those are your two sides?\\
\druggerspeaks \vinphantom{Yes, sir. And those are your two sides?} Ay, sir.\\
\subtlespeaks Make me your door, then, south; your broad side, west:\\
And on the east side of your shop, aloft,\\
Write Mathlai, Tarmiel and Baraborat;\\
Upon the north part, Rael, Velel, Thiel.\\
They are the names of those mercurial spirits\\
That do fright flies from boxes.\\
\druggerspeaks \vinphantom{That do fright flies from boxes.} Yes, sir.\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{That do fright flies from boxes. Yes, sir.} And\\
Beneath your threshold, bury me a load-stone\\
To draw in gallants that wear spurs: the rest\\
They'll seem to follow.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{They'll seem to follow.} That's a secret, Nan!\\
\druggerspeaks I have at home---
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{I have at home---} Ay, I know you have arsenic,\\
Vitriol, sal-tartar, argaile, alkali,\\
Cinoper: I know all. This woman, Captain,\\
Will come, in time, to be a great distiller\\
And give a say---I will not say directly,\\
But very fair---at the philosopher's stone.\\
\facespeaks Why, how now, Annie! Is this true?\\
\druggerspeaks \vinphantom{Why, how now, Annie! Is this true?} (Good Captain,\\
What must I give?)\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{What must I give?)} Nay, I'll not counsel thee.\\
Thou hear'st what wealth he says, spend what thou canst,\\
Thou art like to come to.\\
\druggerspeaks \vinphantom{Thou art like to come to.} I would gi' him a crown.\\
\facespeaks A crown? And toward such a fortune? Heart,\\
Thou shalt rather gi' him thy shop. No gold about thee?\\
\druggerspeaks Yes, I have a portague I have kept this half-year.\\
\facespeaks Out on thee, Nan! 'Slight, there was such an offer.\\
Shalt keep't no longer, I'll give't him for thee. Doctor,\\
Nan prays your worship to drink this and swears\\
She will appear more grateful, as your skill\\
Does raise her in the world.\\
\druggerspeaks \vinphantom{Does raise her in the world.} I would entreat\\
Another favour of his worship.\\
\facespeaks What is't, Nan?\\
\druggerspeaks \vinphantom{What is't, Nan?} But to look over, sir, my almanack\\
And cross out my ill-days, that I may neither\\
Bargain nor trust upon them.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Bargain nor trust upon them.} That he shall, Nan:\\
Leave it, it shall be done, 'gainst afternoon.\\

\facespeaks Why, now, you smokey persecutor of nature!\\
Now do you see, that something's to be done\\
Beside your beech-coal and your crucibles?\\
You must have stuff brought home to you to work on:\\
And yet you think I am at no expense\\
In searching out these veins, then following them,\\
Then trying them out. 'Fore God, my intelligence\\
Costs me more money than my share oft comes to\\
In these rare works.\\

I've spied the gul Sir Epicure Mammon---\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{I've spied the great Sir Epicure Mammon---} Where?\\
\dolspeaks Coming along, at far end of the lane;\\
Slow of his feet but earnest of his tongue\\
To one that's with him.\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{To one that's with him.} Face, go you and shift.\\
\direct*{Exit \face inside}
Dol, you must presently make ready, too.\\
\dolspeaks Why, what's the matter?\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{Why, what's the matter?} O, I did look for him\\
With the sun's rising: marvel he could sleep.\\
This is the day I am to perfect for him\\
The magisterium, our great work, the stone;\\
And yield it, made, into his hands: of which\\
He has, this month, talked as he were possessed.\\
And now he's dealing pieces on't away.\\
If his dream lasts, he'll turn the age to gold.\\
\direct*{Exit \subtle and \dol. Enter \mammon and \surly outside}
\mammonspeaks Come on, sir. Now, you set your foot on shore\\
In Novo Orbe; here's the rich Peru:\\
And there within, sir, are the golden mines,\\
Great Solomon's Ophir! he was sailing to't\\
Three years, but we have reached it in ten months.\\
This is the day wherein, to all my friends,\\
I will pronounce the happy word: be rich.\\
You shall no more deal with the hollow dye\\
Or the frail card. No more shall thirst of satin\\
Or velvet entrails for a rude-spun cloak,\\
Or go a feasting after drum and ensign.\\
No more of this. You shall start up young viceroys,\\
And have your punks and punketees, my Surly.\\
And unto thee I speak it first: be rich.\\
Where is my Subtle, there? Within, ho!\\
\facespeaks \direct*{Calling from off-stage inside} Sir, he'll come to you by and by.\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{Sir, he'll come to you by and by.} That is his fire-drake,\\
His Lungs, his Zephyrus, he that puffs his coals,\\
Till he firk nature up in her own centre.\\
You are not faithful, sir. This night, I'll change\\
All that is metal in my house to gold:\\
And, early in the morning, will I send\\
To all the plumbers and the pewterers,\\
And buy their lead up.\\
\surlyspeaks \vinphantom{And buy their lead up.} What, and turn that too?\\
\mammonspeaks Yes. And I'll purchase Devonshire and Cornwall,\\
And make them perfect Indies! You admire now?\\
\surlyspeaks No, faith.\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{No, faith.} But when you see th' effects of the Great Medicine,\\
You will believe me.\\
\surlyspeaks \vinphantom{You will believe me.} Yes, when I see't, I will.\\
But if my eyes do cozen me so, and I\\
Giving them no occasion, sure I'll have\\
A whore shall piss them out next day.\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{A whore shall piss them out next day.} Ha! Why,\\
Do you think I fable with you? I assure you,\\
He that has once the flower of the sun,\\
The perfect ruby which we call elixir,\\
Not only can do that but, by its virtue,\\
Can confer honour, love, respect, long life;\\
Give safety, valour, yea and victory\\
To whom he will. In eight and twenty days\\
I'll make an old man of fourscore a child.\\
\surlyspeaks No doubt: he's that already.\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{No doubt: he's that already.} Nay, I mean\\
Restore his years, renew him, like an eagle,\\
To the fifth age; make him get sons and daughters:\\
By taking, once a week, on a knife's point,\\
The quantity of a grain of mustard of it.\\
\surlyspeaks The decayed vestals of Pict-hatch would thank you,\\
That keep the fire alive there.\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{That keep the fire alive there.} 'Tis the secret\\
Of nature naturised 'gainst all infections,\\
Cures all diseases coming of all causes;\\
I'll undertake, withal, to fright the plague\\
Out of the kingdom in three months. Meantime,\\
I'll give away so much unto my man,\\
Shall serve the whole city with preservative\\
Weekly; each house his dose and at the rate---\\
\surlyspeaks As he that built the water-work does with water?\\
\mammonspeaks You are incredulous.\\
\surlyspeaks \vinphantom{You are incredulous.} Faith I have a humour:\\
I would not willingly be gulled. Your stone\\
Cannot transmute me.\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{Cannot transmute me.} Pertinax, my Surly,\\
Will you believe antiquity? Records?\\
I'll show you a book where Moses and his sister\\
And Solomon have written of the art;\\
Ay, and a treatise penned by Adam---\\
\surlyspeaks \vinphantom{Ay, and a treatise penned by Adam---} How!\\
\mammonspeaks Of the philosopher's stone and in High Dutch.\\
\surlyspeaks Did Adam write, sir, in High Dutch?\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{Did Adam write, sir, in High Dutch?} He did.\\
I have a piece of Jason's golden fleece,\\
Which was no other than a book of alchemy---\\
So to that fable of Medea's charms,\\
The manner of our work---the bulls, our furnace,\\
Still breathing fire; our argent-vive, the dragon;\\
The dragon's teeth, mercury sublimate,\\
That keeps the whiteness, hardness and the biting;\\
And they are gathered into Jason's helm,\\
The alembic, and then sowed in Mars his field\\
And thence sublimed so often, till they're fixed.\\
All abstract riddles of our stone.\\

You have colour for it, crimson: the red ferment\\
Has done his office; three hours hence prepare you\\
To see projection.\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{To see projection.} Pertinax, my Surly.\\
Again I say to thee aloud: be rich.\\
This day, thou shalt have ingots; and tomorrow\\
Give lords th' affront.---Is it, my Zephyrus, right?\\
Blushes the bolt's-head?\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Blushes the bolt's-head?} Like a wench with child, sir,\\
That were but now discovered to her master.\\
\mammonspeaks Excellent witty Lungs!---my only care\\
Where to get stuff enough now to project on;\\
This town will not half serve me.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{This town will not half serve me.} No, sir! Buy\\
The covering off of churches.\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{The covering off o' churches.} That's true.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{The covering off o' churches. That's true.} Yes.\\
\mammonspeaks Lungs, I will manumit thee from the furnace;\\
I will restore thee thy complexion, Puff,\\
Lost in the embers; and repair this brain,\\
Hurt with the fume o' the metals.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Hurt with the fume o' the metals.} I have blown, sir,\\
Hard for your worship; thrown by many a coal,\\
When 'twas not beech; weighed those I put in, just\\
To keep your heat still even; these bleared eyes\\
Have waked to read your several colours, sir,\\
Of the pale citron, the green lion, the crow,\\
The peacock's tail, the plumed swan.\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{The peacock's tail, the plumed swan.} And, lastly,\\
Thou hast descryed the flower, the sanguis agni?\\
\facespeaks Yes, sir.\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{Yes, sir.} Where's Master?\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Yes, sir. Where's Master?} At his prayers, sir, he;\\
Good man, he's doing his devotions\\
For the success.\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{For the success.} Lungs, I will set a period\\
To all thy labours; thou shalt be the master\\
Of my seraglio.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Of my seraglio.} Good, sir.\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{Of my seraglio. Good, sir.} But do you hear?\\
I'll geld you, Lungs.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{I'll geld you, Lungs.} Yes, sir.\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{I'll geld you, Lungs. Yes, sir.} For I do mean\\
To have a list of wives and concubines\\
Equal with Solomon, who had the stone\\
Alike with me.---Thou saw'st it blood?\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Alike with me.---Thou saw'st it blood?} Aye, sir.\\
\mammonspeaks I will have all my beds blown up, not stuffed;\\
Down is too hard: and then my looking glass\\
Cut in more subtle angles, to disperse\\
And multiply the figures as I walk\\
Naked between my succubae. My mists\\
I'll have of perfume, vapoured 'bout the room,\\
To lose ourselves in; and my baths, like pits\\
To fall into; from whence we will come forth\\
And roll us dry in gossamer and roses.---\\
Is it arrived at ruby?---Where I spy\\
A wealthy citizen or a rich lawyer\\
Have a sublimed pure wife, unto that fellow\\
I'll send a thousand pound to be my cuckold.\\
We will be brave, Puff, now we have the medicine.\\
My meat shall all come in in Indian shells:\\
Dishes of agat set in gold and studded\\
With emeralds, sapphires, hyacinths and rubies.\\
The tongues of carps, dormice and camels' heels,\\
Boiled in the spirit of sol and dissolved pearl,\\
Apicius' diet 'gainst the epilepsy.\\
And I will eat these broths with spoons of amber,\\
Headed with diamond and carbuncle.\\
My foot-boy shall eat pheasants, calvered salmons,\\
Knots, godwits, lampreys: I myself will have\\
The beards of barbels served instead of salads,\\
Oiled mushrooms and the swelling unctuous paps\\
Of a fat pregnant sow, newly cut off,\\
Drest with an exquisite and poignant sauce;\\
For which, I'll say unto my cook, ``There's gold,\\
Go forth and be a knight.''\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Go forth and be a knight.''} Sir, I'll go look\\
A little how it heightens.\\
\direct*{Exit \face inside}
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{A little how it heightens.} Do.---My shirts\\
I'll have of taffeta-sarsnet, soft and light\\
As cobwebs; and for all my other raiment,\\
It shall be such as might provoke the Persian,\\
Were he to teach the world riot, anew.\\
My gloves of fishes' and birds' skins, perfumed\\
With gums of paradise and eastern air---\\
\surlyspeaks And do you think to have the stone with this?\\
\mammonspeaks No, I do think to have all this with the stone.\\
\surlyspeaks Why, I have heard he must be homo frugi:\\
A pious, holy and religious man,\\
One free from mortal sin, a very virgin.\\
\mammonspeaks That makes it, sir; he is so: but I buy it;\\
My venture brings it me. He, honest wretch,\\
A notable, superstitious, good soul,\\
Has worn his knees bare and his slippers bald\\
With prayer and fasting for it: and, sir, let him\\
Do it alone, for me, still. Here he comes.\\
Not a profane word afore him: 'tis poison.---\\

\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{In hope, sir, to convert him.} Son, I doubt\\
You are covetous, that thus you meet your time\\
In the just point: prevent your day at morning.\\
This argues something worthy of a fear\\
Of importune and carnal appetite.\\
Take heed you do not cause the blessing leave you\\

To see my labours, now even at perfection,\\
Got by long watching and large patience,\\
Not prosper where my love and zeal hath placed 'em.\\

Perfect in the instant: something went before;\\
There must be remote matter.\\

\subtlespeaks Marry, we say---\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{Marry, we say---} Ay, now it heats: stand, father,\\
Pound him to dust.\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{Pound him to dust.} It is, of the one part\\
A humid exhalation,which we call\\
Material liquida or the unctuous water;\\
On the other part a certain crass and vicious\\
Portion of earth; both which, concorporate,\\
Do make the elementary matter of gold.\\
Beside, who doth not see in daily practice\\
Art can beget bees, hornets, beetles, wasps\\
Out of the carcases and dung of creatures;\\
And these are living creatures, far more perfect\\
And excellent than metals.\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{And excellent than metals.} Well said, father!\\
Nay, if he take you in hand, sir, with an argument,\\
He'll bray you in a mortar.\\
\surlyspeaks \vinphantom{He'll bray you in a mortar.} Pray you, sir, stay.\\
Rather than I'll be brayed, sir, I'll believe\\

Powder of bones, scalings of iron, glass\\
And worlds of other strange ingredients\\

Intending but one thing; which art our writers\\

Because the simple idiot should not learn it\\
And make it vulgar.\\

And is gone mad with studying Broughton's works.\\
If you but name a word touching the Hebrew,\\
She falls into her fit and will discourse\\
So learnedly of genealogies,\\

Of all mankind.\\

\dolspeaks \vinphantom{O no, not yet this hour. Who is't?} Dapper,\\
Your clerk.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Your clerk.} God's will then, Queen of Fairy,\\
On with your attire; and, Doctor, with your robes.\\
Let's dispatch him for God's sake.
\direct*{Enter \drugger and \kastril outside. \face looks out of the window}
\vinphantom{Let's dispatch him for God's sake.} 'Slight, here are more!\\
Annie and I think the angry boy, the heir,\\
That fain would quarrel.\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{That fain would quarrel.} And the widow?\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{That fain would quarrel. And the widow?} No,\\
Not that I see. Away!\\
\direct*{Exit \subtle and \dol inside. \face opens the door to \dapper}
\vinphantom{Not that I see. Away!} O sir, you are welcome.\\
The doctor is within a moving for you;\\
I have had the most ado to win him to it!---\\
He never heard her highness dote till now.\\
Your aunt has given you the most gracious words\\
That can be thought on.\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{That can be thought on.} Shall I see her grace?\\
\facespeaks See her and kiss her too.---\\
\direct*{\face lets \drugger and \kastril inside}
\vinphantom{See her and kiss her too.---} What, honest Nan!\\
\druggerspeaks Here is tobacco, sir.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Here is tobacco, sir.} 'Tis well done, Nan.\\
\druggerspeaks And here's the gentleman, Captain, Master Kastril,\\
I have brought to see the doctor.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{I have brought to see the doctor.} Where's the widow?\\
\druggerspeaks Sir, as he likes, his sister, he says, shall come.\\
\facespeaks O, is it so? good time. Is your name Kastril, sir?\\
\kastrilspeaks Ay, and the best of the Kastrils, I'd be sorry else,\\
By fifteen hundred a year. Where is the doctor?\\
My mad tobacconist, here, tells me of one\\
That can do things: has he any skill?\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{That can do things: has he any skill?} Wherein, sir?\\
\kastrilspeaks To carry a business, manage a quarrel fairly,\\
Upon fit terms.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Upon fit terms.} It seems, sir, you are but young\\
About the town, that can make that a question.\\
\kastrilspeaks Sir, not so young, but I have heard some speech\\
Of the angry boys and seen them take tobacco;\\
And in his shop; and I can take it too.\\
And I would fain be one of 'em and go down\\
And practise in the country.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{And practise in the country.} Sir, for the duello,\\
The doctor, I assure you, shall inform you,\\
To the least shadow of a hair; and shew you\\
An instrument he has of his own making,\\
Wherewith no sooner shall you make report\\
Of any quarrel, but he will take the height on't\\
Most instantly and tell in what degree\\
Of safety it lies in.
\kastrilspeaks \vinphantom{Of safety it lies in.} But does he teach\\
Living by the wits too?\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Living by the wits too?} Anything whatever.\\
You cannot think that subtlety, but he reads it.\\
He made me a captain. I was a stark pimp,\\
Just of your standing, 'fore I met with him;\\
It is not two months since. I'll tell you his method:\\
First, he will enter you at some ordinary.\\
\kastrilspeaks No, I'll not come there: you shall pardon me.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{No, I'll not come there: you shall pardon me.} For why, sir?\\
\kastrilspeaks There's gaming there and tricks.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{There's gaming there and tricks.} Why, would you be\\
A gallant and not game?\\
\kastrilspeaks \vinphantom{A gallant and not game?} Ay, 'twill spend a man.\\
\facespeaks Spend you! it will repair you when you are spent:\\
How do they live by their wits there, that have vented\\
Six times your fortunes?\\
\kastrilspeaks \vinphantom{Six times your fortunes?} What, three thousand a-year!\\
\facespeaks Ay, forty thousand.\\
\kastrilspeaks \vinphantom{Ay, forty thousand.} Are there such?\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Ay, forty thousand. Are there such?} Ay, sir,\\
And gallants yet.\\
\direct*{\face points to \dapper}
\vinphantom{And gallants yet.} Here's a young gentleman\\
Is born to nothing,---forty marks a year,\\
Which I count nothing:---he is to be initiated,\\
And have a fly of the doctor. He will win you,\\
Within this fortnight, enough to buy a barony.\\
\kastrilspeaks Do you not gull one?  Will the doctor teach this?\\
\facespeaks He will do more, sir. Why, my Nan here knows him.\\
And then for making matches for rich widows,\\
Young gentlewomen, heirs, the fortunatest man!\\
He's sent to, far and near, all over England,\\
To have his counsel and to know their fortunes.\\
\kastrilspeaks God's will, my suster shall see him.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{God's will, my suster shall see him.} You have a sister?\\
\kastrilspeaks Pray thee, tobacconist, go fetch my suster;\\
I'll see this learned boy before I go;\\
And so shall she.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{And so shall she.} Sir, he is busy now:\\
But if you have a sister to fetch hither,\\
Perhaps your own pains may command her sooner;\\
And he by that time will be free.\\
\kastrilspeaks \vinphantom{And he by that time will be free.} I go, sir.\\
\facespeaks Drugger, follow.\\
\direct*{Exit \kastril and \drugger outside}
\vinphantom{Drugger, follow.} Come on, master Dapper,\\
You see how I turn clients here away,\\
To give your cause dispatch; have you performed\\
The ceremonies were enjoined you?\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{The ceremonies were enjoined you?} Yes, of the vinegar,\\
And the clean shirt.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{And the clean shirt.} 'Tis well: that shirt may do you\\
More worship than you think. Your aunt's a-fire,\\
But that she will not shew it, to have a sight of you.\\
Have you provided for her grace's servants?\\
\dapperspeaks Yes, here are six score shillings.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Yes, here are six score shillings.} Good. Hark, the doctor.\\
\direct*{Enter \subtle inside, dressed as the Priest of Fairy}
\subtlespeaks Is yet her grace's cousin come?\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Is yet her grace's cousin come?} He is come.\\
\subtlespeaks And is he fasting?\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{And is he fasting?} Yes.\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{And is he fasting? Yes.} And hath cried ``hum''?\\
\facespeaks Thrice, you must answer.\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{Thrice, you must answer.} Thrice.\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{Thrice, you must answer. Thrice.} And as oft ``buzz''?\\
\facespeaks If you have, say.\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{If you have, say.} I have.\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{If you have, say. I have.} Then, to her cuz,\\
Hoping that he hath vinegared his senses,\\
As he was bid, the Fairy queen dispenses,\\
By me, this robe, the petticoat of fortune;\\
Which that he straight put on, she doth importune.\\
And this piece of her smock the Queen hath sent,\\
Which, being a child, to wrap him in was rent;\\
And prays him for a scarf he now will wear it,\\
With as much love as then her grace did tear it,\\
About his eyes, to show he is fortunate.\\
\direct*{\face and \subtle blindfold \dapper}
And, trusting unto her to make his state,\\
He'll throw away all worldly pelf about him;\\
Which that he will perform, she doth not doubt him.\\
\facespeaks She need not doubt him, sir. Alas, he has nothing,\\
But what he will part withal as willingly,\\
Upon her grace's word---throw away your purse---\\
\direct*{\dapper throws away his purse. \subtle picks it up}
She cannot bid that thing, but he'll obey.---\\
If you have a ring about you, cast it off,\\
Or a silver seal at your wrist; her grace will send\\
Her fairies here to search you, therefore deal\\
Directly with her highness: if they find\\
That you conceal a mite, you are undone.\\
\dapperspeaks Truly, there's all.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Truly, there's all.} All what?\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{Truly, there's all. All what?} My money; truly.\\

\dolspeaks Ti ti!\\

Deal plainly, sir, and shame the fairies. Show\\
You are innocent.\\
\dapperspeaks \vinphantom{You are innocent.} I have nothing but a half-crown\\
Of gold about my wrist, that my love gave me.\\
\facespeaks I thought 'twas something. And would you incur\\
Your aunt's displeasure for these trifles? Come!\\
\direct*{\face takes off \dapper's bracelet}

Now he's on the spit?\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{Now he's on the spit?} Why, lay him back

\subtlespeaks With some device. Would her grace speak with me?\\
I come.---Help, Dol!\\

My master's in the way. Please you to walk\\
Three or four turns, but till his back be turned,\\

At dinner in her bed and she has sent you\\
From her own private trencher, a dead mouse,\\
And a piece of gingerbread, to be merry withal,\\

To any body, till then.\\

A stay in his mouth.\\

Touching your bounty and your noble spirit---\\
\mammonspeaks Hast thou?\\

But, good sir, no divinity in your conference,\\
For fear of putting her in rage.---\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{For fear of putting her in rage.---} I warrant thee.\\
\facespeaks Six men, sir, will not hold her down: and then,\\
If the old man should hear---\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{If the old man should hear---} Fear not.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{If the old man should hear--- Fear not.} You know\\
How scrupulous he is and violent,\\
Against the least act of sin. Physic, or mathematics,\\
Poetry, state, or bawdry, as I told you,\\
She will endure and never startle; but\\
No word of controversy.\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{No word of controversy.} I am schooled, good Ulen.\\

\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{I told your ladyship---} Madam, with your pardon,\\
I kiss your vesture.\\
\dolspeaks \vinphantom{I kiss your vesture.} Sir, I were uncivil\\
If I would suffer that; my lip to you, sir.\\

\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{(Well said, my Guinea bird.)} Right noble madam---\\
\facespeaks (O, we shall have most fierce idolatry.)\\
\mammonspeaks 'Tis your prerogative.\\
\dolspeaks \vinphantom{'Tis your prerogative.} Rather your courtesy.\\
\mammonspeaks Were there nought else to enlarge your virtues to me,\\
These answers speak your breeding and your blood.\\
\dolspeaks Blood we boast none, sir, a poor baron's daughter.\\
\mammonspeaks Poor! and gat you? profane not. Had your father\\
Slept all the happy remnant of his life\\
After that act, lien but there still and panted,\\
He had done enough to make himself, his issue,\\
And his posterity noble.\\
\dolspeaks \vinphantom{And his posterity noble.} Sir, although\\
We may be said to want the gilt and trappings,\\
The dress of honour, yet we strive to keep\\
The seeds and the materials.\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{The seeds and the materials.} I do see\\
The old ingredient, virtue, was not lost,\\
There is a strange nobility in your eye.\\
This lip, that chin! methinks you do resemble\\
One of the Austriac princes.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{One of the Austriac princes.} Very like!\\
(Her father was an Irish costermonger.)\\
\mammonspeaks The house of Valois just had such a nose,\\
And such a forehead yet the Medici\\
Of Florence boast.\\
\dolspeaks \vinphantom{Of Florence boast.} Troth, and I have been likened\\
To all these princes.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{To all these princes.} (I'll be sworn, I heard it.)\\

But e'en the very choice of all their features.\\

\dolspeaks \vinphantom{Good lady, give me leave---} In faith, I may not,\\
To mock me, sir.\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{To mock me, sir.} To burn in this sweet flame;\\
The phoenix never knew a nobler death.\\
I see you're lodged in the house of a rare man,\\
An excellent artist; but what's that to you?\\
\dolspeaks Yes, sir; I study here the mathematics,\\
And distillation.\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{And distillation.} O, I cry your pardon.\\
He's a divine instructor!
\dolspeaks \vinphantom{He's a divine instructor!} Troth, I am taken, sir,\\
Whole with these studies, that contemplate nature.\\
\mammonspeaks It is a noble humour; but this form\\
Was not intended to so dark a use.\\
I muse, my lord your brother will permit it:\\
You should spend half my land first, were I he.\\
Does not this diamond better on my finger,\\
Than in the quarry?\\
\dolspeaks \vinphantom{Than in the quarry?} Yes.\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{Than in the quarry? Yes.} Why, you are like it.\\
You were created, lady, for the light.\\
Here, you shall wear it; take it, the first pledge\\
Of what I speak, to bind you to believe me.\\
\dolspeaks In chains of adamant?\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{In chains of adamant?} Yes, the strongest bands.\\
And take a secret too---here, by your side,\\
Doth stand this hour, the happiest man in Europe.\\
\dolspeaks You are contended, sir!\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{You are contended, sir!} Nay, in true being,\\
The envy of princes and the fear of states.\\
\dolspeaks Say you so, sir Epicure?\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{Say you so, sir Epicure?} Yes, and thou shalt prove it,\\
Daughter of honour. I have cast mine eye\\
Upon thy form and I will rear this beauty\\
Above all styles.\\
\dolspeaks \vinphantom{Above all styles.} You mean no treason, sir?\\
\mammonspeaks No, I will take away that jealousy.\\
I am the lord of the philosopher's stone,\\
And thou the lady.\\
\dolspeaks \vinphantom{And thou the lady.} How, sir! have you that?\\
\mammonspeaks I am the master of the mystery.\\
This day the good old wretch here of the house\\
Has made it for us: now he's at projection.\\
Think therefore thy first wish now, let me hear it;\\
And it shall rain into thy lap, no shower,\\
But floods of gold, whole cataracts, a deluge,\\
To get a nation on thee.\\
\dolspeaks \vinphantom{To get a nation on thee.} You are pleased, sir,\\
To work on the ambition of our sex.\\
\mammonspeaks I am pleased the glory of her sex should know,\\
This nook, here, of the Friars is no climate\\
For her to live obscurely in. Come forth!\\
And taste the air of palaces; eat, drink\\
The toils of empirics and their boasted practice;\\
Tincture of pearl and coral, gold and amber;\\
Be seen at feasts and triumphs; have it asked,\\
What miracle she is; set all the eyes\\
Of court a-fire, like a burning glass,\\
Thus will we have it.\\
\dolspeaks \vinphantom{Thus will we have it.} I could well consent, sir.\\
But, in a monarchy, how will this be?\\
The prince will soon take notice and both seize\\
You and your stone, it being a wealth unfit\\
For any private subject.\\

\dolspeaks Yourself do boast it, sir.\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{Yourself do boast it, sir.} To thee, my life.\\
\dolspeaks O, but beware, sir! You may come to end\\
The remnants of your days in a lothed prison,\\
By speaking of it.\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{By speaking of it.} 'Tis no idle fear.\\
We'll therefore go withal, my girl, and live\\
In a free state, where we will eat our mullets,\\
Soused in high-country wines, sup pheasants' eggs,\\
And have our cockles boiled in silver shells;\\
Our shrimps to swim again, as when they lived,\\
In a rare butter made of dolphins' milk,\\
Whose cream does look like opals; and with these\\
Delicate meats set ourselves high for pleasure,\\
And take us down again and then renew\\
Our youth and strength with drinking the elixir,\\
And so enjoy a perpetuity\\
Of life and lust! And thou shalt have thy wardrobe\\
Richer than nature's, still to change thy self,\\
And vary oftener, for thy pride, than she,\\
Or art, her wise and almost-equal servant.\\

The angry tongue he talks in?\\
\subtlespeaks \vinphantom{The angry tongue he talks in?} That false precept,\\
Of being afore-hand, has deceived a number,\\
And made them enter quarrels, often-times,\\
Before they were aware; and afterward,\\
Against their wills.\\

Have been saluted. I do call you lady,\\
Because you are to be one, ere it be long,\\

\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{All in a twinkling.} The whole nest are fled!\\
\lovewitspeaks What sort of birds were they?\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{What sort of birds were they?} A kind of choughs,\\
Or thievish daws, sir, that have picked my purse\\
Of eight score and ten pounds within these five weeks,\\
Beside my first materials; and my goods,\\
That lie in the cellar, which I am glad they have left,\\
I may have home yet.\\
\lovewitspeaks \vinphantom{I may have home yet.} Think you so, sir?\\
\mammonspeaks \vinphantom{I may have home yet. Think you so, sir?} Ay.\\
\lovewitspeaks By order of law, sir, but not otherwise.\\
\mammonspeaks Not mine own stuff!\\
\lovewitspeaks \vinphantom{Not mine own stuff!} Sir, I can take no knowledge\\
That they are yours, but by public means.\\
If you can bring certificate that you were gulled of them,\\
Or any formal writ out of a court,\\
That you did cozen your self, I will not hold them.\\
\mammonspeaks I'll rather lose them.\\
\lovewitspeaks \vinphantom{I'll rather lose them.} That you shall not, sir,\\
By me, in troth: upon these terms, they are yours.\\
What! should they have been, sir, turned into gold, all?\\
\mammonspeaks No,\\
I cannot tell---It may be they should.---What then?\\
\lovewitspeaks What a great loss in hope have you sustained!\\
\mammonspeaks Not I, the commonwealth has.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Not I, the commonwealth has.} Ay, he would have built\\
The city new; and made a ditch about it\\
Of silver, should have run with cream from Hogsden.\\
\mammonspeaks I will go mount a turnip-cart and preach\\
The end of the world, within these two months. Surly,\\
What! in a dream?\\
\surlyspeaks \vinphantom{What! in a dream?} Must I needs cheat myself,\\
With that same foolish vice of honesty!\\
Come, let us go and hearken out the rogues:\\
That Face I'll mark for mine, if e'er I meet him.\\
\facespeaks If I can hear of him, sir, I'll bring you word,\\
Unto your lodging; for in troth, they were strangers\\
To me, I thought them honest as my self, sir.\\
\direct*{Exit \mammon and \surly outside. Enter \persecution and \tribulation inside}
\tribulationspeaks 'Tis well, the Saints shall not lose all yet. Go,\\
And get some carts---\\
\lovewitspeaks \vinphantom{And get some carts---} For what, my zealous friends?\\
\persecutionspeaks To bear away the portion of the righteous\\
Out of this den of thieves.\\
\lovewitspeaks \vinphantom{Out of this den of thieves.} What is that portion?\\
\persecutionspeaks The goods sometimes the orphan's, that the Sisters\\
Bought with their silver pence.\\
\lovewitspeaks \vinphantom{Bought with their silver pence.} What, those in the cellar,\\
The knight sir Mammon claims?\\
\persecutionspeaks \vinphantom{The knight sir Mammon claims?} I do defy\\
The wicked Mammon, so do all the Sisters,\\
Thou profane man!\\
\lovewitspeaks \vinphantom{Thou profane man!} Mine earnest vehement botcher,\\
And Pastor also, I cannot dispute with you:\\
But if you get you not away the sooner,\\
I shall confute you with a cudgel.\\
\persecutionspeaks \vinphantom{I shall confute you with a cudgel.} Sir!\\
\tribulationspeaks Be patient, Persecution.\\
\persecutionspeaks \vinphantom{Be patient, Persecution.} I am strong,\\
And will stand up, well girt, against an host\\
That threaten Gad in exile.\\
\lovewitspeaks \vinphantom{That threaten Gad in exile.} I shall send you\\
To Amsterdam, to your cellar.\\
\persecutionspeaks \vinphantom{To Amsterdam, to your cellar.} I will pray there,\\
Against thy house: may dogs defile thy walls,\\
And wasps and hornets breed beneath thy roof,\\
This seat of falsehood and this cave of cozenage!\\
\direct*{Exit \persecution and \tribulation outside. \drugger enters
  outside and looks in through the open door}
\lovewitspeaks Another too?\\
\direct*{\lovewit beats \drugger. Exit \drugger outside}
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Another too?} No, this was Annie Drugger.\\
If you get off the angry child, now, sir---\\
\direct*{Enter \kastril and \pliant inside}
\kastrilspeaks Come on, you ewe, you have matched most sweetly, have you not?\\
Did not I say, I would never have you tupped\\
But by a dubbed boy, to make you a lady-tom?\\
Death, mun' you marry, with a pox!\\
\lovewitspeaks \vinphantom{Death, mun' you marry, with a pox!} You lie, boy;\\
As sound as you; and I'm aforehand with you.\\
\kastrilspeaks Anon!\\
\lovewitspeaks \vinphantom{Anon!} Come, will you quarrel? I will feize you, sirrah;\\
Why do you not buckle to your tools?\\
\kastrilspeaks \vinphantom{Why do you not buckle to your tools?} Od's light,\\
This is a fine old boy as e'er I saw!\\
\lovewitspeaks What, do you change your copy now? proceed;\\
\kastrilspeaks 'Slight, I must love him! I cannot choose, i'faith,\\
An I should be hanged for it! Suster, I protest,\\
I honour thee for this match.\\
\lovewitspeaks \vinphantom{I honour thee for this match.} O, do you so, sir?\\
\kastrilspeaks Yes, an thou canst take tobacco and drink, old boy,\\
I'll give her five hundred pound more to her marriage,\\
Than her own state.\\
\lovewitspeaks \vinphantom{Than her own state.} Fill a pipe full, Jeremy.\\
\facespeaks Yes; but go in and take it, sir.\\
\lovewitspeaks \vinphantom{Yes; but go in and take it, sir.} We will---\\
I will be ruled by thee in any thing, Jeremy.\\
\kastrilspeaks 'Slight, thou art not hide-bound, thou art a jovy boy!\\
Come, let us in, I pray thee, and take our whiffs.\\
\lovewitspeaks Whiff in with your sister, brother boy.\\
\direct*{Exit \kastril and \pliant inside}
\vinphantom{Whiff in with your sister, brother boy.} That master\\
That had received such happiness by a servant,\\
In such a widow and with so much wealth,\\
Were very ungrateful, if he would not be\\
A little indulgent to that servant's wit,\\
And help his fortune. Therefore, gentlemen,\\
And kind spectators, if I have outstript\\
An old man's gravity, or strict canon, think\\
What a young wife and a good brain may do;\\
Stretch age's truth sometimes and crack it too.\\
Speak for thy self, knave.\\
\facespeaks \vinphantom{Speak for thy self, knave.} So I will, sir. Gentlemen,\\
My part a little fell in this last scene,\\
Yet 'twas decorum. And though I am clean\\
Got off from Subtle, Surly, Mammon, Dol,\\
Hot Persecution, Dapper, Drugger, all\\
With whom I traded: yet I put my self\\
On you, that are my country: and this pelf\\
Which I have got, if you do quit me, rests\\
To feast you often and invite new guests.\\
