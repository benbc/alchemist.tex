My edition
==========

Re-distribute fairies' "ti-ti" stuff, so that there is a simultaneous translation, with the verse working.
Rewrite stage directions:
 - remove extraneous stuff
 - simplify locations (inside/outside)
 - downcase
 - latex-generated names
 - don't use speech prefixes to assign actions
Re-check warnings after rewriting the stage directions.
Get rid of quotes at end
Work out how to designate asides (in brackets?)
Mark Face's costumes
Should I mark elisions for verse?
Get rid of dramatis personae
