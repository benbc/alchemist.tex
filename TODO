re-format dol raving with mammon/face speaking at the same time
increase type size

My edition
==========

Re-distribute fairies' "ti-ti" stuff, so that there is a simultaneous translation, with the verse working.
Rewrite stage directions:
 - from p66
Re-check warnings after rewriting the stage directions.
Get rid of quotes at end
Work out how to designate asides (in brackets?)
Should I mark elisions for verse?
Get rid of dramatis personae? (keep for auditions?)
Re-work act/scene divisions

Mammon and Dol exit just before Subtle enters (p64, "Dost thou not laugh? / Yes; are they gone? / All's clear."). Does this need two internal exits?
